This script is inspired by emacs's haskell-unicode-cuteness and based on vimscript #284 by Jos van den Oever.
Converts all lambdas, equality, non-equality, get, let and arrows (<-, ->) to correspoding unicode symbols. If you think that I should add more characters, please feel free to email me or post your wishes in comments.
